            Studied Estate Management by chance. My immediate elder brother was
            a student of Architecture Faculty of Environmental Studies at UNN
            Enugu Campus. He had his best friend ESV Romanus Okoli studying
            Estate Management in the same faculty. It was through my brothers
            friend I came to know about Estate Management took interest in the
            course and the rest is History.

            The Head of State General Murital Mohammed had declared Abuja the
            Nations capital in 1976 and maybe actual work started two years
            later. By the time I joined FCDA in 1981, Abuja was still very young
            worked with FCDA for 7 years and then left in 1989 to Portland
            Oregon, USA.

          <p className="text-gray text-justify mb-0">
            My life actually changed for good while living in the USA First I
            got more education in business and more importantly in Marketing and
            Sales. Also I did a lot of self-motivational courses in phycology
            and sales. My confidence grew While in the USA, I worked for UPS
            (United Parcel Service) one of the world's leading Parcel Company
            .... It was a baptism of fire. The most tedious job you can imagine.
            As a student at Portland State University UPS regularly recruited
            from our campus.. The attraction for me was the late night shift
            that enabled me to continue with my studies and their pay per hour
            that was more than double the minimum wage.

          <h5> My Personal Story</h5>
          <p className="text-gray mb-0">
            But the work was so tedious and most times after my shift I could
            not go to school because I will sleep all day. I vowed while working
            for UPS that; I will work for myself and own my own business that if
            I can put in half the energy in my own business.. I will surely
            succeed that is how I started a one-man carpet cleaning business.
            When I came back to Nigeria, I started Cheers Hotel and continue my
            Real Estate practice In Abuja, I was doing well in both my practice
            and business and was extending a lot of empowerment to my people in
            my village, my people actually invited me to join politics because
            they figured out my generosity could carry me through and it did.

            Well, I re-started my practice in 2020 and also gave full attention
            to my Hotel business, I have been fairly successful. As I reflect on

            extensive self help motivational learning my work experience both
            home & abroad, my political career and philanthropy I dreamt a

          <h5>Current Focus</h5>
          <p className="text-gray mb-0">
            My main focus now is to help people acquire or sell land or property
            in Abuja FCT. The diaspora community has a special package called
            Diasporas.. own a piece of Abuja. An Estate Land or Property that
            now has a pathway to CofO. Many Nigerians struggle abroad but our
            fallen exchange rate favors them greatly. For about 3,000 US
            dollars, you can own a piece of Land in Abuja. For a start, you can
            visit Abuja stay in my Hotel, get a tour of the city make your
            choice and invest.
